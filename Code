Write a function that returns a string in which firstname is swapped with last name.
Example(Input --> Output)
"john McClane" --> "McClane john"
A)
function nameShuffler(str){
  //Shuffle It
  let strArr = str.split(" ")

  return lastFirst
}

8 kyu					Grasshopper - If/else syntax debug
Q) If/else syntax debug
While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to create a function to check if the user is still alive called checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.
checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive should return true if the player's health is greater than 0 or false if it is 0 or below.
A) 
function checkAlive (health) {
  if (health <= 0) {
    return false
  } else {
    return true
  }
}
Better
function checkAlive (health) {
  return (health <= 0) ? false : true
  }
Best
function checkAlive (health) {
  return health >0
  }

8 kyu			Quarter of the year
Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.
For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.
Constraint:
1 <= month <= 12
const quarterOf = (month) => {
  // Your code here
 if (month < 4){
   return 1
 }
  else if (month < 7){
    return 2
  }
  else if (month <10){
    return 3
  }
  else{
    return 4
  }
}

7 kyu			  Credit Card Mask
Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.
Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.
Examples (input --> output):
"4556364607935616" --> "############5616"
     "64607935616" -->      "#######5616"
               "1" -->                "1"
                "" -->                 ""
// "What was the name of your first pet?"
"Skippy" --> "##ippy"
"Nananananananananananananananana Batman!" --> "####################################man!"
function maskify(cc) {
  let newString = [];
  let hashtagSymbol = "#";
  for (let i = 0; i < cc.length -4; i++) {
    newString.push(hashtagSymbol);
  }
  return newString.join('') + cc.slice(-4);
}
Alt
function maskify(cc) {
      let symbol = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < cc.length; i++) {
        if (i < (cc.length - 4))
        {symbol.push("#")}
        else 
        {symbol.push(cc[i])}
      }
//we need .join to turn this from multiple entries in an array to a single string.
      return symbol.join("");
    }
Alt
function maskify(cc) {
// the number after the the -4 is a check for a minimum; that minimum being 0 here
      let replaceThis = Math.max(cc.length - 4, 0);
      let mask = "#";
      let finalProduct = mask.repeat(replaceThis);
      return finalProduct + cc.slice(-4);
    }
Alt
// return masked string
function maskify(cc) {
  let result = '';
  for (let i=0; i<cc.length; i++) {
    if (i<cc.length-4) result += '#';
    else result += cc[i];
  }
  return result;
}

7 kyu					Find the capitals
Instructions
Write a function that takes a single string (word) as argument. The function must return an ordered list containing the indexes of all capital letters in the string.
Example (Input --> Output)
"CodEWaRs" --> [0,3,4,6]
var capitals = function (word) {
	// Write your code here
	let capCount = []
	 let newArray = word.split('');
	//This line is regex for a capital letter between capital A and capital Z
	 for(i=0; i<=newArray.length; i++ ){ 
		if (word[i] >= 'A' && word[i] <= 'Z')
			(capCount.push (i))}
	 return (capCount)
  }
//Testing completed code here to ensure it gets the correct results
console.log(capitals("JEForyDFrrDdffD"))
//Console response
(7) [0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 14]
